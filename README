The dotSkapes Project is a suite of tools for finding, analyzing, sharing, and tagging research.

The platform is being developed at the Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment at UW-Madison (http://sage.wisc.edu).

This is a Web2Py application, that requires a Python environment running Web2Py (http://web2py.com/). The application is being designed to be compatible with Sahana Eden disaster management tools (http://eden.sahanafoundation.org/). Our code has been inspired by the work of the Sahana Foundation (http://sahanafoundation.org/).
